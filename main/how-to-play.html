                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        There are 16 words and 4 categories. Each category contains 4 words that relate to each other under some "theme." 
                        The categories will be color-coded based on difficulty. From easiest to hardest, the colors are green, yellow, blue, and purple.
                        The categories can be found in any order (i.e., you don't need to find them in a particular order). 
                    </p>

                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        Click on the words to select them. After selecting 4 words, press "Submit" to check your answer.
                        If your answer is correct, the category will appear. Otherwise, a message will be appear at the top. 
                        If only one word is incorrect, the message will say so. If more than one word does not belong, 
                        the message will simply say "incorrect". If you make 4 mistakes, the 4 categories will automatically be revealed.
                        You can also shuffle the remaining words, since that might help you see some patterns in the words. 
                        Don't worry about accidentally repeating an incorrect guess &mdash; if you've already made that guess, it won't count as a mistake!
                    </p>

                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        There are currently 5 puzzles available. A puzzle will be randomly chosen everytime you play the game. 
                        Try to play them all!
                    </p>

                <h2>WORDLE</h2>
                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        You have 6 tries to guess what the mystery 5-letter word is. 
                        Type in your 5-letter guess in the empty box at the bottom. When you're ready, press "Guess".
                    </p>

                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        Letters that are in the word and in the correct position of the word will be highlighted in blue-green.
                        Letters that are in the word but NOT in the correct position will be highlighted in yellow.
                        Letters that are NOT in the word will be highlighted with gray.
                    </p>


                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        A record of the letter highlighting will be shown at the bottom of the page to help keep track of
                        which letters worked and didn't work. There are currently 32 possible words that will be randomly chosen from when starting the game.
                    </p>

                <h2>ETYPEMO</h2>
                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        After starting the game, a word will appear in the middle of the screen. 
                        You can immediately start typing in the word in the text box without having to click on it (mind the timer!).
                        Type the words as fast as you can! If you finish typing within the time limit, a new word will appear, and your score will update.
                        If you run out of time, the game will end.
                    </p>

                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        There are different difficulties for the words &mdash; easy, moderate, and hard.
                        The difficulty/word will be chosen randomly. As you successfully type more words,
                        you'll get extra seconds added to your time remaining (depending on the word's difficulty).
                        Try to beat the best score!
                    </p>

                <h2>MEMORY</h2>
                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        There are 12 tiles and 6 different kinds of tiles. Click on a tile to reveal what pattern it has.
                        After you click two tiles, you can see if you matched the tiles. If you matched them correctly, your score will increase.
                        If you make a mistake, the tiles will become blank again, and your score will decrease (your score can never be negative).
                    </p>

                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        See how high a score you can get!
