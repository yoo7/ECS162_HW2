                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        This website was created for ECS 162: Web Programming at UC Davis. 
                        The goal was to apply our new JavaScript knowledge (in combination
                        with our previous HTML and CSS skills) to produce some games.
                    </p>

                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        The games we have available are recreations of the New York Times "Connections" and "Wordle", which were built from scratch. 
                        We also incorporated two open-source games! 
                    </p>

                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        The first open-source game is called eTypeMo. We added to its word list, including adding a new difficulty called "insane".
                        We also significantly changed the styling/organization to integrate it with the visuals of our site.
                    </p>

                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        The second open-source game is Memory. We added some visual changes like a message pop-up instead of an alert and a fade-out 
                        animation when tiles are correctly matched. Furthermore, the game has an added mechanic where you score can decrease from 
                        mistakes to raise the stakes and make the game more interesting. Tiles were converted into buttons for keyboard accessibility.
                    </p>
