                        This website was created for ECS 162: Web Programming at UC Davis. 
                        The goal was to apply our new JavaScript knowledge (in combination
                        with our previous HTML and CSS skills) to produce some games.
                    </p>

                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        The games we have available are recreations of the New York Times "Connections" and "Wordle", which were built from scratch.
                        We also incorporated two open-source games. The first one is called eTypeMo. We added to its word list, including adding a new difficulty called "insane".
                        The second open-source game is Memory. We added some visual changes like a message pop-up instead of an alert and a fade-out animation when tiles are correctly matched.
                        Furthermore, the game has an added mechanic where you score can decrease from mistakes to raise the stakes and make the game more interesting.
