                        There are 16 words and 4 categories. Each category contains 4 words that relate to each other under some "theme." 
                        The categories will be color-coded based on difficulty. From easiest to hardest, the colors are green, yellow, blue, and purple.
                        The categories can be found in any order (i.e., you don't need to find them in a particular order).

                        Click on the words to select them. After selecting 4 words, press "Submit" to check your answer.
                        If your answer is correct, the category will appear. Otherwise, a message will be appear at the top. 
                        If only one word is incorrect, the message will say so. If more than one word does not belong, 
                        the message will simply say "incorrect". If you make 4 mistakes, the 4 categories will automatically be revealed.
                        You can also shuffle the remaining words, since that might help you see some patterns in the words. 
                        Don't worry about accidentally repeating an incorrect guess &mdash; if you've already made that guess, it won't count as a mistake!
