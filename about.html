                        This website was created for ECS 162: Web Programming at UC Davis. 
                        The goal was to apply our new JavaScript knowledge (in combination
                        with our previous HTML and CSS skills) to produce some games.
                    </p>

                    <p class="basicParagraph">
                        The games we have available are recreations of the New York Times "Connections" and "Wordle", which were built from scratch.
                        We also incorporated an open-source game [INSERT GAME HERE] [INSERT ADDITIONAL FEATURES].
